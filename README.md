Scala Project Template Using SBT
======

This repository makes it easy to start your own Scala project using SBT.

The project goes beyond the basics and gives you a way to organize your settings and plugins.

Suggest plugins:

- sbt-assembly: To create an uber-jar
- sbt-buildinfo: To propagate build information into your project


To run the code first clone the repository ```git git clone https://github.com/imarios/ScalaSbtTemplate.git```

Make sure you have `sbt` installed. Then run `sbt compile run`.
